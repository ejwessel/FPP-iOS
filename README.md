# Fundamental Plasma Parameters #

This App is meant to be used as a reference and not as a definitive resource for plasma computations. It features the Fundamental Plasma Parameters found on pg. 29 & 30 of the 2006 NRL Plasma Formulary. 
All quantities are in Gaussian cgs units except temperature (T, Te, Ti) expressed in eV and ion mass (mi) expressed in units of the proton mass, µ = mi/mp; Z is charge state; k is Boltzmann’s constant; K is wavenumber; γ is the adiabatic index; ln Λ is the Coulomb logarithm.

FPP was a response to help my fellow colleagues and physicists when I interned at an Research and Development Fusion Company facility as a Software Engineer.
